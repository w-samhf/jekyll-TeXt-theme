### Welcome to my blog!

I'm currently an undergrad student at IIIS@Tsinghua, majoring computer science. I intend to use this little site to (occasionally) share topics I find interesting in CS/phyics/maths; hope that you'll like them:)

In case you want to know more about me, a rough CV is provided below. A pdf version is available [here](/files/cv.pdf).

### Education
- 2010.8-2016.6 Affiliated High School of SCNU
- 2016.8-present Tsinghua University'

### Interests
Have a strong interest in both CS and physics, and particularly interested in quantum information.

I am also an astronomy amateur, and enjoy stargazing. I am also a big fan of Bayern Munich.

### Language Proficiency
**Chinese:** Native speaker

**English:** Fluent
- TOEFL: Reading 30, Listening 30, Speaking 27, Writing 25

- GRE: Verbal 170, Quantitative 170, Writing 4.5

### Research Experience
* 2017, instructed by Dr. Zhangqi Yin and Prof. Bei Zeng, researched on the capabilities of IBM’s quantum processor; experimentally demonstrated that the device is capable of producing fully entangled states (inseparable states w.r.t. fixed partition using all physical qubits); first author of the article that presents our results.

### Other Experience and Achievements
* 2015, won Gold Medal in Chinese Physics Olympiad
* 2017, visited University of Oxford for 3 weeks as part of Tsinghua University Distinguished Students Summer Programme
* 2017, received 9th of December Scholarship (for distinguished sophomores in Tsinghua)
